                            <p class="project-description">My first website project was both simple and functional. It was the result of learning the basics of web development and putting my newfound knowledge into practice.At the beginning of the project, I focused on creating a website
                                that was easy to navigate and understand. I wanted it to be user-friendly, with a clean and minimalistic design. I also aimed to keep the website functional, ensuring that it fulfilled its intended purpose.The entire process
                                of building my first website project was a great learning experience. It gave me a deeper understanding of web development and sparked my interest in learning more about this field.This project was a tribute to Prizren,
                                my beloved city. The project was a way for me to express my love and appreciation for the city by showcasing its beauty and rich history through a website.Through the project, I was able to share my passion for Prizren
                                with others and highlight the unique cultural and architectural features that make the city so special.

                            <p class="project-description">My second project was a weather app website that I developed after learning about APIs. With my newfound knowledge of API integration, I was able to create a website that provided real-time weather data to users.The website
                                was designed to be simple and intuitive, with a clean and modern layout that made it easy to use. Users could enter their location or search for a specific city, and the website would display the current weather conditionsTo
                                create the website, I used an API to gather the necessary weather data and integrated it into my website code.Building this weather app website was a challenging but rewarding experience. I gained a deeper understanding
                                of API integration and honed my web development skills. The project also allowed me to create something that could be useful to others, which was a great feeling. I look forward to continuing to learn and create more projects
                                in the future.</p>
